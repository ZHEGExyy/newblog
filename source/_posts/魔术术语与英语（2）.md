>#### *P1* ---preparation
>Once your participant finishes **shuffling**, take thepack from her and **square** the cards (*整叠牌*) by **tapping** their short ends (*牌的短边*) on the table. <u>Under the cover of</u> this natural action, secretly **glimpse** the bottom card of the deck. Let’s assume the Ace of Spades is your Key Card.

>#### *P2* ---select
>**Spread** the cards and <u>have her select any card</u> she wishes. If she takes the bottom card, you’re <u>way ahead</u> because you already know what it is.
>#### *P3* ---cut
>Once she has <u>noted</u> her selection, begin to **cut** small packets of cards to the table, one on top of the other, forming a haphazard pile.

>#### *P4* ---drop
>*“I’ll **drop** the cards to the table like this. Please tell me to stop whenever you like.”*
>#### *P5* ---burying
>Once she tells you to stop cutting, have her place her selection on top of the pile on the table. Then, place the rest of your cards on top of her selection, burying it in the middle. Your Key Card is now surreptitiously above her selected card.
>#### *P6* ---cut（a straight cut）
>Pick up the deck and hold it in dealing position (*发牌手*). Give the deck a straight cut, placing about half to the table and then dropping the rest on top, and say, “Alice, pick up the cards and cut them like this so that you have no idea where your card is.”
>#### *P7* ---cut again （a straight cut）
>As she cuts, observe how well she follows your instructions. If she cuts them well, you can tell her to pick up the cards and cut them again while you turn away, saying, *“I’ll look away so that there’s no way I know even the approximate location of your selection. I don’t want either of us to know where it is. We want this experiment to be as close to double-blind as possible.”*
>#### *P8* ---特殊情况
>Pick up the cards and square them, again by tapping their short ends on the table. This will allow you to glimpse the bottom card. If you see your Key Card (in our example, the Ace of Spades), you know that her selection is the top card, which you could <u>sell</u> as your <u>effect</u> right away. If you don’t see your Key Card, continue as follows.
>#### *P9* ---deal（台词）
>*“In a moment, Alice, I’m going to ***deal*** the cards face up(正面向上发牌) to the table one at a time. You will look at the cards, and I will look at you. If you see your selection, try not to have any reaction. However, the moment you see it, I want you to think the word ‘stop.’ Don’t say it aloud. Just think it. Do you understand?”*

>#### *P10* 
>Once she indicates her understanding, begin to deal the cards face up to the table in an overlapping row.
>#### *P11* ---dealing
>Be sure to look at her most of the time and only <u>glance down</u> every five cards or so to check for your Key Card.
>#### *P12* ---stop（台词）
>If you find yourself dealing for some time, you can break up the monotony by pausing the deal and cheekily saying, *“The word we’re going for is ‘stop,’ remember?”* This implies that you know she hasn’t thought ‘stop’ yet, which is an effect in itself.
>#### *P13* ---continue dealing then stop
>Once you reach the key card or glance down to see that you passed it, continue dealing a card or two and say, *“I felt something a moment ago. You just thought ‘stop,’ didn’t you? . . . Not here, but a few cards back. Is that right?”*
>#### *P14* ---reply
>She will reply affirmatively.
>#### *P15* ---find
>Feign a few more seconds of difficulty and then remove from the spread the card that follows your Key Card, saying, *“You thought ‘stop’ right here.”*
